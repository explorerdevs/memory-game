# memory-game üß†

This is a simple memory game built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript.

## How to play ‚õπüèº

The goal of the game is to flip over pairs of matching cards. Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its image. If the image on the card matches the image on the previously flipped card, the pair will disappear from the board. If the images do not match, the cards will flip back over. The game ends when all pairs have been matched.
